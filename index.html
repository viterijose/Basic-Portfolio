        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jose Viteri and ever since I was a kid I dreamed of becoming an inventor. <br>
           What started as a child's dream has now become a career, with the knowledge I will <br>
           acquire from this course I wish to come closer to inventing, not just electrical or <br>
           mechanical gadgets, but also websites and apps that may let me control them.<br>
            <br>
           Besides me dreaming of becoming an inventor, I really enjoy going to the gym, <br>
           trying out new restaurants and enjoying a nice glass of beer while watching my <br>
           two pups play in my backyard.
