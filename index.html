                <p> My name is Jose Viteri and ever since I was a kid I dreamed of becoming an inventor.What started as a child's
                    dream has now become a career, with the knowledge I will acquire from this course I wish to come closer to
                    inventing, not just electrical or mechanical gadgets, but also websites and apps that may let me control
                    them.
                    <br>
                    <br> Besides me dreaming of becoming an inventor, I really enjoy going to the gym, trying out new restaurants
                    and enjoying a nice glass of beer while watching my two pups play in my backyard.
