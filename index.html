    <h2 class="heading-2">About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Jose Viteri and ever since I was a kid I dreamed of becoming an inventor.
        <br>
        <br> What started as a child's dream has now become a career, with the knowledge I will
        <br>
        <br> acquire from this course I wish to come closer to inventing, not just electrical or
        <br>
        <br> mechanical gadgets, but also websites and apps that may let me control them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Besides me dreaming of becoming an inventor, I really enjoy going to the gym,
        <br>
        <br> trying out new restaurants and enjoying a nice glass of beer while watching my
        <br>
        <br> two pups play in my backyard.
